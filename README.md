# react-dynamic-table
A [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) table component that allows for dynamic CRUD as well as callback functions to have finer control over the default CRUD operations.

## Motivation
There are many well-built React table components on the internet, but when you want to go beyond just showing static data, your choices suddenly become very limited. I couldn't find a single React component that will allow me to update the content of the table dynamically with callback options for me to also persist the update in the backend database. 

So I decide to build one myself.

## Usage Demo
[Demo](http://jhuang78.github.io/react-dynamic-table/#/demo). Just start clicking on it. It should be fairly intuitive on how to interact with this table.

## Install
`npm install --save react-dynamic-table`
